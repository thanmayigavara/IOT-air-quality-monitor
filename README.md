IoT-Based Air Quality Monitoring System

This project involves the development of an IoT-enabled Air Quality Monitoring System that tracks environmental parameters such as PM2.5 and PM10 levels and displays the data in real-time on a display screen . The system is designed to provide users with continuous insights into the quality of air in their surroundings, promoting healthier living and environmental awareness.

Objective:

To build a smart, low-cost device that continuously monitors air pollutants, and displays  real-time metrics on a user-friendly display screen.


How It Works:

1. Air quality sensors continuously measure PM2.5, PM10.


2. The microcontroller reads the data and sends it via Wi-Fi.

3. The display screen displays live readings which help in analyzing air quality.



Real-Time Monitoring: Instant access to current air quality levels.
